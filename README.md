MeowPay is a decentralized salary payment platform designed to guarantee freelancers and employees receive their wages securely and without delays. The system combines a smart contract, a subgraph for indexing via The Graph, and a modern web application.

Employers can pre-fund and lock their organization’s account, giving freelancers and employees confidence that their payments are guaranteed. Once work is registered, employees can trigger their payments anytime, ensuring financial autonomy and security.
